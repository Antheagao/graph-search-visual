# Graph Search Visualizer

A full-stack pathfinding visualization platform that demonstrates and compares classic graph search algorithms including **A\***, **Dijkstra**, **BFS**, **DFS**, and **Bidirectional BFS**.  
Built with **React (JavaScript)** for the interactive frontend and **Python FastAPI** for the backend algorithm engine.

## Features
- 🎨 **Interactive Visualization** – Animated grid showing visited nodes and the solution path in real time.  
- ⚡ **Backend Benchmarking** – FastAPI service runs algorithms and returns runtime, nodes expanded, and path length.  
- 📊 **Algorithm Comparison** – Compare performance metrics across algorithms (A\* vs. Dijkstra vs. BFS/DFS).  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Works across desktop and mobile with smooth animations.
